# Analysis and comparison of results
#Education vs. Earnings:
#The correlation coefficient between education and earnings is 0.386, indicating a moderate positive relationship. This suggests that individuals with higher levels of education tend to earn more, though the relationship is not particularly strong. Education appears to be a factor in higher earnings but is likely not the sole determining factor.
#Hours Worked vs. Earnings:
#The correlation between hours worked and earnings is 0.248, indicating a weak positive relationship. This suggests that working more hours is associated with slightly higher earnings, but the effect is weaker compared to education. The relatively low correlation implies that hours worked may not have a substantial impact on earnings by itself.
#Comparison of Education and Hours Worked on Earnings:
#Education shows a stronger association with earnings than hours worked, as evidenced by its higher correlation (0.386 vs. 0.248). This indicates that, in this dataset, educational attainment has a more significant impact on earnings than the number of hours worked.#'
